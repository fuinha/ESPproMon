ESPproMon © Smartphone App for Energy Monitoring with **Appp © Technology**

What is Appp © Technology?

It's **app**liance **p**rofiling which allows you to identify when specific appliances are powered up or powered down etc. It's very much in it's infancy but fully expected to be the next big thing in Smart Energy Monitoring.

The first files we are including in this repository are for the emonTx and Arduino Shield supplied by [Open Energy Monitor](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/) Arduino in **Wales**. You will find the sketches in [this](https://github.com/pieman64/ESPproMon/tree/master/OpenEnergyMonitor) directory.

The emonTx is available in kit form for the Arduino Uno and Leonardo. This is the kit we received and found the build procedure very straightforward.

This is the completed shield fitted to a Leonardo with a DS18B20 sensor and USB2TTL adaptor fitted. It also has the **AC - AC** adaptor that's essential if you want to accurately measure Real Power and therefore real Energy costs.

More to follow in due course.
